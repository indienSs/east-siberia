      "Olkhon (Russian: Ольхо́н, also transliterated as Olchon; Buryat: Ойхон, Oikhon) is the third-largest lake island in the world. It is by far the largest island in Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia, with an area of 730 km2 (280 sq mi). The island is large enough to have its own lakes, and features a combination of taiga, steppe and even a small desert. A deep strait separates the island from the land. The island's appearance is a result of millions of years of tectonic movement resulting in the hollowing of the channel between the land (Maloe More Sound and Olkhon Gate Strait) and the block of stone forming the island. The steep slopes of the mountains show the vertical heave of the earth.",

      "The Arshan resort itself includes two sanatoriums: Sayany and Arshan, which are part of the sanatorium-resort association of trade unions Baikalkurort. The sanatoriums are located in the Tunkinskaya valley at the foot of the monumental Sayan mountains with snow-capped peaks, on the picturesque mountain river Kyngyrga, flowing down to Arshan in a narrow valley with waterfalls. The main natural healing factors are carbonic, low-mineralized, siliceous sulfate-hydrocarbonate-magnesium-calcium weakly acidic thermal waters and sulfide silt mud, which highly effectively treat diseases of the digestive system, blood circulation, respiration, urinary and endocrine systems, and metabolism. The mineral waters of the Arshan resort have a wide temperature range: from cold (11-13 °C) to hot (45 °C). According to the chemical composition, mineral waters, according to the classification of V.A. Aleksandrov, belong to the 1st class, being carbonic with a high content of gas.",

      'The name "Warm Lakes" unites three reservoirs, which are located almost 200 kilometers from Irkutsk, where the mountain river Snezhnaya flows into Lake Baikal. In the dense forest, at the foot of the mountains, you can swim, sunbathe, fish and admire the picturesque forest lakes: Emerald, Snow (Warm Lake) and Skazka (Dead Lake). Mountain lakes are not interconnected in any way. They are completely different from each other. Even the water in them differs in its chemical composition. It is known that one of them arose during the melting of glaciers, and the other two were formed after quarrying. It is better to go here on a weekday, as there are a lot of people here on weekends. The main factor that attracts tourists is warm water and picturesque surroundings. This place is perfect for family holidays.',

      "The city of Baikalsk is located in one of the most beautiful places in Eastern Siberia - on the southeastern coast of Lake Baikal at the foot of the Khamar Daban mountain range, and is famous primarily for its ski resort, pomegranate beach and the annual strawberry festival. Thanks to the closure of the pulp and paper mill, Baikalsk has fully restored its tourist attractiveness, not only due to the most beautiful places, but also due to excellent ecology. And the proximity of the water mass of Lake Baikal creates a unique mild climate for Siberian places. The average temperature in winter in these places is 10 - 15 degrees below zero, and summer is famous for its constant comfortable temperature of +25 degrees throughout the summer period. From Baikalsk it is also convenient to make tourist trips to the most beautiful places of the Baikal region: the Utulik River, the relict forest, the Khamar Daban ridge, the Warm and Sable Lakes, the Baikal Reserve.",
